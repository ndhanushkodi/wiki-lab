Most of the burger app functionality is there,
but there are a few things I didn't quite get to:

1. When a new ingredient is added, the page needs to be refreshed for it to show up at the bottom of the list. This is because I didn't get to adding a partial to render the new ingredient form.

2. When you check ingredients for the order, the running total adds correctly, but doesn't take into account when you uncheck ingredients at this time. So if you check, uncheck, and recheck an ingredient, it's getting added twice to the order total. 

3. There's no real way for the user to fully delete an ingredient.
